# choose_algo
Choose which algorithm you want to train your data on with train_model.py and you can load and test it by using test_model.py.
Some toy data has been provided in data and a model has already been saved in model.p. It contains a Decision Tree Classifier which is trained on the wine dataset from sklearn.
This will be overwritten when you run the train_model script. If you want to save your new model in a separate file, change the file name that you want to save it to (i.e. change model.p to svm.p). Note that you will need to specify which model you are using in the test_model script.
